With all the recent activity on 1.6, 1.5 was a little bit left behind.

For the last 4 months, a few fixes have accumulated there, including the annoying one striking again on http-send-name-header.

Another one may cause the old process to die during a soft reload when a proxy references a disabled peers section.

The next annoying one affects those who set memory limits to their processes, as the memory size computation was accidently performed on 32-bits which is limited by todays standards (4GB max) so a typical 5 GB allocation would result in 1 GB only due to integer overflow.

The remaining patches are for minor bugs, cleanups and doc updates.

For the vast majority of users there's no emergency to update.

However if you're deploying now, please consider using this version in order to avoid these bugs later.

Code and changelog are available [here](/download/1.5/src/) as usual.
