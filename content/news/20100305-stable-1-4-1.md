title: "stable 1.4.1"
date: 2010-03-05

Some build issues on non-Linux platforms were preventing new 1.4 adopters from trying it. These issues are now fixed. [Other issues](/download/1.4/src/CHANGELOG) concerned the appearance of more 502 errors in the logs than with 1.3. This was a bug that caused the status code to be changed to 502 even in case of connection abort during the data transfer. A few new error counters were added to the stats, and other minor issues were fixed. This new version now builds and works on FreeBSD, OpenBSD, OSX, Solaris, AIX and Linux, so let's not wait and [**release 1.4.1**](/download/1.4/src/).

Also, Solaris users will now be happy, I unpacked and replugged my Ultra5 so the Sparc binary is available again.

On a side note, I have removed the link to the haproxy.org mirror because it has been outdated for the last 6 months and even remained 1 week on an expired DNS zone. I failed several times to contact Kevin Kuang there, so I don't even know who manages it now if any. If someone gets in touch with him, please ask him to contact me.
