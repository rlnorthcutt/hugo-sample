A cool video demonstration of the **connection regulation mechanism** (maxconn) [has been posted on 37signals](http://www.37signals.com/svn/posts/1073-nuts-bolts-haproxy). It's clearly explained and explicit enough for people not much aware of the mechanism to understand it. Check it there, it's not too long and really worth seeing.
