HAProxy 1.6.1 has been released with the fixes for the pending bugs introduced in 1.6.0, including the SSL crash when two certs were present on a line, the issue with impossibility to bind frontends when namespaces were enabled but not used, the incorrect use of ANY type DNS queries, and a few doc and build issues.

The small number of bugs (3) in one week is much smaller than what we had in 1.5 (7) in less time, which is encouraging, and matches the quality we were reaching in the last -dev versions.

As usual, code and changelog are available [here](/download/1.6/src/).
