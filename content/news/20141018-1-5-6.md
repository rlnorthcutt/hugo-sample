Very few fixes this time, 1.5.6 fixes the annoying bug reported this week about disabled proxies, an issue in the URI hash (the question mark of a query string was accidently hashed when present), an off-by-one when checking the stick-counter number in "track-sc" rules, resulting in the "track-sc3" action being accepted and reported as valid but ignored, and slightly improves the systemd wrapper.

Code and changelog are available [here](/download/1.5/src/).
