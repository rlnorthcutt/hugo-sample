Opened **development branch 1.3**, which started with a major cleanup.

Not sure yet about all features which will be merged, the first step is to clean up the code and make it modular.

The API's licence has been switched to **LGPL** in order to later allow linking with binary external modules developped for applications covered by NDAs for example.

Version 1.3.0 is exactly the same as 1.2.14+bugfixes so it is a stable starting point.

It is [available here](download/1.3/src).
