Since 1.4.15 was released 2 months ago, very few minor bugs were detected. They were so minor that it was worth waiting for other ones to be found, but after some time, there wasn't any point making users wait any more, so I [released 1.4.16](/download/1.4/src/). A few minor improvements were also made based on feedback from users. Among the changes, MySQL checks now support Mysqld versions after 5.5, health checks support for multi-packet response has been fixed, the HTTP 200 status can be configured for monitor responses, a new http-no-delay option has been added to work around buggy HTTP implementations that assume packet-based transfers, chunked-encoded transfers have been optimised a bit, the stats interface now support URL-encoded forms, and halog correctly handles truncated files. There is no real emergency to upgrade.
