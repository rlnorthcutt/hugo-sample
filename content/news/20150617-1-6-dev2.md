This version marks the feature freeze for 1.6.

The number of changes is as huge as for dev1, in part due to many last-minute features being rushed into it.

Among the changes since dev1, we can enumerate DNS-based server name resolution, server address change from the CLI, peers protocol updated to v2 to replicate everything in stick-tables, improved support for peers and multi-process, removal of some deprecated keywords, pattern matching cache for faster regex match, stateless ZIP compression using [libslz](http://1wt.eu/projects/libslz/), support for variables to ease data manipulation, declared captures to allow captures on responses and in backends, SSL cert forgery on the fly, device identification with [DeviceAtlas](https://deviceatlas.com/deviceatlas-haproxy-module) and [51Degrees](https://github.com/51Degreesmobi/51Degrees-C), updated default DH params for improved protection against the [logjam attack](https://weakdh.org/), support of quotes and environment variables everywhere in the configuration language, automatic quoting in the stats CSV output, redirect on HTTP responses, stricter detection of duplicated backend or server names, support for multiple redispatches on failed retries, request body processing, TLS ticket keys loading from file and update from CLI, "option http-ignore-probes" to silently ignore 400/408 caused by browser preconnect, disabling of HTTP/0.9 by default, stricter memory allocator for Lua, and many internal changes.

The more detailed changelog can be read [here in the announce](http://marc.info/?l=haproxy&m=143455374508423&w=2).

Server state conservation across reloads is still being reviewed and will hopefully be merged before dev3.

Code and changelog are available [here](/download/1.6/src/devel/) as usual.
