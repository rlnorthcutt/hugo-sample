There's nothing really critical this time.

The most important part is the replacement of the dh-param groups provided by default in order to avoid the issues brought with logjam.

Some bugs were found in the tcp-checks rules processing and were fixed.

If you use tcp-checks, you'd be safe with this update.

Another one is an issue that was reported in 1.5.12 with peers trying to immediately reconnect upon error and eating a lot of CPU.

An old issue was reported regarding TIME\_WAIT sockets on the server side caused by POST requests terminated with abort-on-close.

Now we apply NOLINGER to avoid this.

And there's this backport I announced but forgot about peers now being usable with nbproc > 1 provided that each section is referenced by tables from only one process.

Code and changelog are available [here](/download/1.5/src/) as usual.
