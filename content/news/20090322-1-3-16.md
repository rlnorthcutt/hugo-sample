Minor fixes and enhancements have been added since the second release candidate. So, that's it, **[1.3.16](download/1.3/src/)** is out and marks the new official stable release. As it has already received long testing from major users, I'm not worried about its stability, eventhough I expect that a few bugs will surface. Further development will continue in a new branch, and 1.3 will only receive fixes and minor enhancements.
