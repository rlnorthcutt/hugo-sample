title: "stable 1.4.3 and 1.3.24"

A few remaining issues and one regression [were fixed](/download/1.4/src/CHANGELOG) in 1.4. In 1.3, I have [backported](/download/1.4/src/CHANGELOG) all pending fixes since 1.3.23, most of which were discovered in 1.4. The most interested people will probably be users of FreeBSD where they could randomly get a SIGPIPE if the program was compiled on a very recent version (8, maybe 7.2 too). Anyway, due to other minor to medium fixes, 1.3 users should upgrade.  
It's worth noting that very few issues were reported on 1.4.2. The code has stabilized very quickly, and people in sensible environments will be able to start to think about evaluating it to plan an upgrade (from most reports, the new features such as client keep-alive and improved stats are very much demanded). If I could send them an advice, I'd say that we're going to release 1.4.4 soon with a few minor improvements and that if some people don't know what version they will start with, then let's start with 1.4.4 when it's available.
