There was nothing really critical on the 1.6 front but a number of fixes were pending among which some against painful bugs when hitting out of memory conditions. 1.5 had been lagging for quite longer and received fixes against a few risks of crashes when misusing sc\_trackers, another rare crash in zlib not happening with slz, some situations where random connections can be frozen during a redispatch, and an issue with gcc 6 where the listening address could be ignored. For more info, you can check the [full 1.6.11 announcement here](https://www.mail-archive.com/haproxy@formilux.org/msg24440.html) and the [1.5.19 announcement here](https://www.mail-archive.com/haproxy@formilux.org/msg24441.html).

Code and changelogs are available [here for 1.6](/download/1.6/src/) and [here for 1.5](/download/1.5/src/) as usual.
