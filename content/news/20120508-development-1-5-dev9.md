Many new features [were added](/download/1.5/src/CHANGELOG) since 1.5-dev7 (I forgot to announce dev8 here). Let's summarize this shortly : new logging subsystem with customizable log formats, a unique-ID generator, full rework of the buffers and HTTP message storage, merge of the ACL and pattern fetch code, ACL support for IPv6 addresses, cookies, URL parameters and arbitrary payload, support for specifying a precise occurrence in fetch functions, much better error reporting for ACL parsing errors, the long-awaited "use-server" directive, minor improvements to the error capture reports, and a significant number of bugfixes. Please [give it a test](/download/1.5/src/).
