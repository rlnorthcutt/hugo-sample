A few hours after 1.3.21 was issued, John Lauro reported an important regression causing a crash when connecting to the stats socket. This was caused by a minor backport which should have been modified for 1.3 and that I didn't detect during the tests because I did not use this socket. **1.3.22** was released to fix this issue. Please don't use 1.3.21 and update to 1.3.22!
