We are very pleased to announce our first-ever user conference, HAProxyConf 2019 which will take place in Amsterdam on November 12 and 13.  
We are designing this conference with our community in mind. All sessions will be highly informative and technical in nature, without marketing fluff. There will be a heavy focus on presentations from end-users, who will share their use cases and real-world recommendations. We also expect the conference to be a fun time and a great opportunity to connect with several hundred of your peers from across Europe and beyond.  
We very much want our community members to play a big role in the conference. With that in mind, please consider submitting an abstract as part of our call-for-papers process, which is now open. You can submit your abstracts by visiting the [conference website](http://haproxyconf.com/). Please note that any submissions that are obviously vendor or product pitches will not be considered by the content selection committee. Abstracts much be submitted by June 21, 2019. All chosen presenters will receive a free, full conference pass.  
If you have any questions about the conference or the call-for-papers process, please contact us at [submission@haproxy.com](mailto:submission@haproxy.com).
