A new batch of annoying issues got fixed.

Among [these issues](/download/1.4/src/CHANGELOG), we can find a risk of crash (broken pipe) on very recent versions of FreeBSD, a segfault when using CLF logs and capturing a non existant header, a very rare case of stuck client session when using keep-alive, some garbage which appeared on the stats page after 1000 client resets, or when the host name was too long, a url\_param hash bug which could result in a dead server to be used in very rare situations, a risk of getting an empty result on the stats socket if the input closes before haproxy responds, and endless loop at config parsing time on the error-limit keyword, status codes 501 and 505 which could cause a server to be marked down if on-error was used, and a risk of getting truncated HTTP responses when chunk-encoding was used with chunk sizes that are exact divisors of the buffer size, and an issue with anonymous ACLs which were merged together into a single one.

A few improvements were made to the health checks which now support multi-packet responses, and the stats socket can now display more debug information about a specific connection.

The list is quite huge, it was important to [**release 1.4.2**](/download/1.4/src/) without waiting for any possible new issue to come, eventhough things seem to calm down.
