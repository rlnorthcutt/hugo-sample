title: "stable 1.4.8 and 1.3.25"

Today, Ben Congleton, Morten Gade Sørensen and Hervé Commowick reported and diagnosed two bugs in 1.4.7. One was a regression introduced in 1.4.7, breaking the stick-table feature due to a side effect of the fix for a memory leak in it. The second one is quite old, it dates 1.3.16 (2 years old) ! It causes crashes soon after a connection has matched a monitor-net in a tcp-only instance. I wanted to quickly fix both issues so that users who have not yet upgraded to 1.4.7 don't waste their time, and I'm very grateful to the 3 guys above who were extremely reactive and allowed the bugs to be fixed in a few hours. Finally, Patrick Mézard's doc updates were merged too.

Version [1.4.8](/download/1.4/src/CHANGELOG) was released, with [sources](/download/1.4/src/), Linux and Solaris [binaries](/download/1.4/bin/) at the usual places. Version [1.3.25](/download/1.3/src/CHANGELOG) was released too with a few other pending fixes, and [sources](/download/1.3/src/) and Linux/Solaris [binaries](/download/1.3/bin/) at the usual places too.

Users of 1.3 after 1.3.16, or 1.4 with TCP only frontends will likely want to upgrade, eventhough if they have not been hit yet, they will probably never be. Users of stick-tables will have to upgrade too. The fact that we're now spotting bugs that have been there for two years is an encouraging sign of stability.
