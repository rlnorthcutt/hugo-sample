Dmitry Sivachenko reported that an occurrence of "-ldl" accidently slipped into the makefile in 1.5.7, complicating builds on systems like FreeBSD with no libdl. Godbach fixed a bug which appears only when users force tune.maxrewrite to 0 (which is impractical in production), and which causes buffer insertions to write at the wrong location and to crash the process. There's no security impact here given that such configurations cannot be used in production. I preferred to issue a new version so that everyone can upgrade without trouble. If you already run with 1.5.7, then you don't need to upgrade to 1.5.8. Code and changelog are available [here](/download/1.5/src/) as usual.
