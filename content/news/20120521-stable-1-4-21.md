A number of old bugs were reported recently. Some of them are quite problematic because they can lead to crashes while parsing configuration or when starting up, which is even worse considering that startup scripts will generally not notice it. Among the bugs that [1.4.21 fixes](/download/1.4/src/), we can list : risk of crash if using reqrep/rsprep and having tune.bufsize manually configured larger than what was compiled in, risk of crash when using header captures on a TCP frontend (uncaught invalid configuration), risk of crash when some servers are declared with checks in a farm which does not use an LB algorithm (eg: "option transparent" or "dispatch"), "balance source" did not correctly hash IPv6 addresses resulting in IPv4 connections to IPv6 listeners always having the same hash. Some other minor fixes and improvements were merged. While it's very likely that almost nobody is affected by the bugs above, troubleshooting them is annoying enough to justify an upgrade.
