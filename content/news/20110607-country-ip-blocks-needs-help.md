title: "Country IP Blocks needs help"

Quite a few HAProxy users rely on geolocation lists freely provided by [Country IP blocks](http://www.countryipblocks.net/), either to add a request header indicating the origin country, or to select the datacenter closest to the client. Now this nice service needs some money to continue operations otherwise they're forced to close. They're asking for donations. Their service has been offered for free with a high quality to many HAProxy users for some time now, I think it would really be fair that these users in turn help their nice provider. They need **$2000 before next week**, this certainly is achievable if all big site using their lists donate $100 each to keep them alive. **Never forget that for any free software or service on the Net, there are always people working hard to keep the service alive and who have to pay bills at the end of the month**.
