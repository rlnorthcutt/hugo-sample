A large number of bugs were fixed again since 1.5-dev10, some of them being regressions from 1.5-dev8 and later versions. See the [changelog](/download/1.5/src/CHANGELOG) for more information, but nobody should be running on dev9 nor dev10. Minor harmless features were added in dev11, such as new actions on the stats page, a few new cookie options, and some minor improvements on URI hashing and server recovery mode. Users should really [upgrade](/download/1.5/src/), as I don't want to waste time trying to spot stupid bugs in configs that are notoriously broken.
