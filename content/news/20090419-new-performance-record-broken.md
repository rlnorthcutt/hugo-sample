title: "new performance record broken !"

It was a long time since my last 10 Gigabit tests, exactly one year. The Linux kernel has evolved a lot, so did HAProxy and even the Myri10GE driver. I knew we could get much throughput since we fixed the kernel splice() syscall. It was a good opportunity to start a [new series of benchmarks again](10g.html). In short, new records were broken. Full **10Gig** line rate with **20% CPU**, and the **100000** sessions/s barrier was crossed !
