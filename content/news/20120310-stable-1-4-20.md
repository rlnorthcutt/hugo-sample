A few bugs were reported since 1.4.19 was released, and some were found in 1.5 during development.

Servers tracking disabled servers would still be used while disabled.

Zero-weight servers could still dequeue requests pending in the backend's queue.

The build was broken on FreeBSD since 1.4.19.

Since the introduction of client keep-alive, a server would not pick a pending requests after releasing a connection if it keeps exactly maxconn-1 connections, which is problematic with low maxconn values.

POST requests smaller than the buffer would experience an undesirable additional delay of 200ms due to a flag being left unconditionally enabled on the buffer.

Sometimes when sending data wrapping across the buffer, haproxy would fail to merge TCP segments into a single one, which results in a few PUSH packets that can sometimes be observed during chunked-encoded transfers (this was just a missed optimization). [1.4.20 was released](/download/1.4/src/) with all these changes.

Some of them are important enough to justify an upgrade, eventhough they've been here for a very long time.
