While trying to work on end-to-end keep-alive, I encountered issues that needed to be fixed, so this has delayed dev7 quite a lot, and it does still not have this end-to-end keepalive.

Think of it as a much cleaner dev6 instead since many bugs were fixed.

The stickiness code sponsored by [Exceliance](http://www.exceliance.fr/) and [Loadbalancer.org](http://www.loadbalancer.org/) got merged.

Currently, it can almost only learn IP addresses, but it has been designed with an amazing flexibility so that it will be very easy to add stickiness on any request or response criteria.

MySQL checks have been introduced and this code will evolve for slightly deeper and more reliable checks.

A new "force-persist" statement allows admins to test their servers without opening them to the world, which is very convenient to ensure they're correctly installed and that their customers will not face a lot of crap.

And as always, a bunch of bugs in many areas were fixed.

**Update:** 1.4-dev5 to 1.4-dev7 had a nasty bug with keep-alive enabled, so please update to 1.4-dev8.
