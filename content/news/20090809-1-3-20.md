Cristian Ditoiu from [transfer.ro](http://www.transfer.ro/) reported a major regression when testing 1.3.19. It would crash within a few minutes while 1.3.15.10 was OK. He offered to help so we could run gdb and debug the crash live. We finally found that the crash was the result of a regression introduced by a recent in 1.3.19. I really want to thank him because he spontaneously provided a lot of help and trust to debug this issue which at first glance looked impossible after reading the code and traces, but took less than an hour to spot and fix when caught live in gdb ! It's always pleasant when users show that level of involvement to chase bugs.

Another bug was reported by Romuald du Song, who found that option tcplog would log using global parameters if no logger was defined. It can be either helpful or annoying. This is now fixed and a warning is emitted when such a configuration is encountered, so that people running off erroneous configs can easily fix them.

This time I expect **[1.3.20](download/1.3/src/)** to be _the good one_. It's always a good sign when we fix minor bugs or recent regressions introduced by bug fixes. **[1.4-dev2](download/1.4/src/)** has also been released to help people track changes in the two versions in parallel.
