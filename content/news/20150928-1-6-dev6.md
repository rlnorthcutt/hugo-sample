HAProxy 1.6-dev6 has just been issued with 35 bugfixes and 22 doc updates. A few extra features were merged, among which server state conservation across reload, Lua applet registration, RFC5424-compliant log header and structured data extension, cpu-map support on FreeBSD, TCP silent-drop action, and support for any address family in Lua co-socket. Please check for the details in [the mailing list's announce](http://marc.info/?l=haproxy&m=144347978408109&w=2). Please test it this week so that we can group last fixes and doc updates next week for a release in less than 2 weeks. As usual, code and changelog are available [here](/download/1.6/src/devel/).
