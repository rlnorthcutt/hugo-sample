I've just released HAProxy 1.5.17 which fixes the CPU usage regression introduced in 1.5.16 after improperly fixing the buffer space calculation code.

It also fixes another bug impacting header captures when there are exactly MAX\_HDR\_HISTORY headers captured (10 by default), in which case the process may crash by dereferencing a pointer at a negative position in the pointers history.

The remaining patches are minor bugs and documentation.

All users of 1.5 should upgrade to 1.5.17, there are too many bugs impacting older versions.

Code and changelog are available [here](/download/1.5/src/) as usual.
