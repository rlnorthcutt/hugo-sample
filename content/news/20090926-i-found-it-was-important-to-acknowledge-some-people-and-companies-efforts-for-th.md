I found it was important to acknowledge some people and companies' efforts for the project. So I added [a new page](/contrib.html) listing significant contributions, most often features but sometimes fixes, in the form of patches, code, time or even money. A minor bug on the stats page which remained in 1.4-dev3 has also been fixed and is available [in the latest snapshot](/download/1.4/src/snapshot/).
