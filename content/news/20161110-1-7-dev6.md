HAProxy 1.7-dev6 was released on 2016/11/10.

It completes a 13 months development cycle with some nice features that have been awaited for a long time, and managed to fix all the remaining bugs that were reported after the 1.6 release (1.6.10 will be issued soon with the fixes).

The main last features are the support for starting the process with a configuration containing servers which do not resolve and to let them resolve later, the ability for the DNS resolver to finally mark a server as temporarily down on resolution failure (and obviously up again on success), initial support for OpenSSL 1.1.0 (with temporary loss of support for the now obsolete OpenSSL 0.9.8), and the [Stream Processing Offload Engine](http://www.haproxy.org/download/1.7/doc/SPOE.txt) (SPOE for short) letting haproxy delegate some processing to external components for various reasons (CPU usage, high latencies, reliability, event-driven incompatible development model, etc).

We also merged a third device detection engine, WURFL (developed by [Scientiamobile](https://www.scientiamobile.com)).

It's a bit late in the development cycle for such stuff but the code is very well isolated and very clean so there's no reason not to take it.

A few minor performance improvements on large requests or responses were done as well (about 10% faster with 1kB cookie and 100-chars URIs).

It is supposed to be the last version before the final release.

Code cleanups are more than welcome (and needed in some areas).

A few of them area already ongoing.

The complete announcement is [available here](http://www.mail-archive.com/haproxy@formilux.org/msg24095.html).

Code and changelog are available [here](/download/1.7/src/) as usual.
