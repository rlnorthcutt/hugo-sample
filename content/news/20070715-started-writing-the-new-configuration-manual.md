Started writing the new **[Configuration Manual](download/1.3/doc/configuration.txt)**.

It enumerates all configuration keywords and in what context they may be used.

It also includes a few examples of ACLs.

It is not finished yet, but I decided to publish it because people have really no other valuable sources of information to use content switching.

It only covers version 1.3.12, and updates will only cover the latest version, making it far more readable.

Please take a look at it and start from the examples in the examples/ directory from the sources.

Any feedback is welcome :-)
