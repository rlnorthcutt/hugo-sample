Since 1.3.18 was released two months ago, it has been widely deployed, in part thanks to the _slowloris_ tool which has caused HAProxy downloads to jump by 20-30%. This results in more exposure and [new kinds of bugs](download/1.3/src/CHANGELOG) to be discovered. The most annoying ones concern too short sessions which may sometimes be reported as server errors, random delays under low traffic conditions due to a scheduler bug, and the last one reported today by an [Exceliance](http://www.exceliance.fr/ahproxy.htm) customer who was kind enough to provide lots of traces, some occasional pauses on interactive TCP traffic which might also happen on the last chunk of an HTTP response, although extremely rarely. Each one alone would have been enough to issue a new maintenance release, so here it is, **[1.3.19](download/1.3/src/)**. It also brings a small bunch of nice new features backported from the dev tree, among which the support for multiple configuration files, the support for more than 64k concurrent connections (tested at 190k by the heavy user), and a highly better reporting of config warnings and errors. So, as usual with maintenance releases... everyone is highly encouraged to upgrade.

Since some of the bugs above were present in earlier versions, a new release was emitted for 1.3.15 and 1.3.14 too for the late users who have not upgraded yet. I really think it's the last one for 1.3.14. 1.3.15 might still see another one till the end of the year, and that will probably be all for this one after 20 months of free support :-)

The first development version should be released too, but I need to update my release scripts first, they are inadequate and take me too much time to use, so stay tuned !
