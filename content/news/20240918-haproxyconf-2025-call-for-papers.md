The next edition of the HAProxyConf will be held on June 4-5 2025, with some workshops on June 3.

The [Call for Papers is open](https://www.haproxyconf.com/call-for-papers/).

If you feel like you're doing awesome things with HAProxy, that it eases your job, reduces your costs, if you think you've figured smart ways to use it and want to share your findings, if you've written useful companion tools that your friends constantly tell you you should advertise more, and even if you want to express some criticism, please consider submitting a paper to the link above.

If you just want to attend, see where it's held, how to get there or register, you can also [visit the conference's site](https://www.haproxyconf.com/) (registrations are expected to open very soon).
