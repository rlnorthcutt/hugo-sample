I have put online a [matrix of all known bugs](/bugs/index.html) which affect stable versions 1.3 starting with 1.3.14.

It took about 4 hours of work to put that in shape but I think it was worth it.

Let's put it short : those of you running **1.3.15.2**, **1.3.16** or **1.3.17** are **doomed**.

Those running **1.3.15.X before 1.3.15.7**, **1.3.19** or **1.3.21** are at **risk**.

**1.3.14.14**, **1.3.15.10** and **1.3.20** are pretty **good**, and **1.3.22** is the only one with **no known bug** yet.
