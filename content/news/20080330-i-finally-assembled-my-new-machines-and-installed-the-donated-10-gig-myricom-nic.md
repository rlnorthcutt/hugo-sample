I finally assembled my new machines and installed the donated 10-Gig Myricom NICs. I ran a few benchmarks. Result: **[new bandwidth records set for HAPoxy: 9.897 Gbps and 35128 hits/s!](/10g.html)** It's possibly the highest bitrate achieved to date with an opensource load-balancer! BTW, even most commercial ones are commonly limited to 4 Gbps by hardware design. What's a bit frustrating for a precision-tweaker like me is that those NICs work out-of-the box on dirt cheap hardware, there's almost no joy passing beyond the first 4 Gbps :-)
