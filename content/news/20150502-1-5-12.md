A number of annoying bugs were fixed during the last 3 months, it was time for an update.

Two of them may result in a crash with very specific configurations.

A number of fixes to comply with RFC7230 were made.

Till now we used to comply with 2616 but it was not strict enough and could cause interoperability issues in some corner cases.

A new feature was backported : "option http-ignore-probes".

It disables logging, responses 400/408 and error counters for empty connections that could result from pre-connect from some clients.

People are seeing up to 25% of them in their stats or logs, so it made sense to backport this from 1.6.

Another improvement consists in a relax of the restriction between peers and nbproc.

Now it is possible to use peers provided that the whole section is only used by tables belonging to the same process.

This makes it easier to run SSL offloading in multiple processes now.

Code and changelog are available [here](/download/1.5/src/) as usual.
