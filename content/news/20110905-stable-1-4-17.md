Last week an issue was discovered with an application emitting spaces after the content-length value, which caused haproxy to report an error when parsing it.

After some checks, it appeared that haproxy ought to ignore these spaces, so this was addressed.

It was an opportunity to improve invalid request and responses captures, so that any message rejected for its malformation can be captured.

A new minor feature making the X-Forwarded-For header addition conditional was added because users had to resort to complex tricks to do that.

Last, halog was updated to latest version.

Due to the issue with the header above, I [released 1.4.17](/download/1.4/src/).

Quite frankly most users don't need to upgrade.

However it's better to use this one for new deployments.
