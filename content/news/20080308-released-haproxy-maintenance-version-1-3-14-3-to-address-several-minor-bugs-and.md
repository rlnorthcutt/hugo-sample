Released **[haproxy maintenance version 1.3.14.3](download/1.3/src/)** to address several minor bugs and clean up the configuration manual a little bit. One annoying issue with backup servers in round robin mode was fixed. Nothing really important was changed in this version, this makes it a good candidate for distro updates.
