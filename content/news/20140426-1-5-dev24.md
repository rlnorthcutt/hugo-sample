This version fixes 3 major regressions from dev23, one causing transfers to be interrupted after the configured timeout, another one where redirects could sometimes cause a crash, and one slowing down SSL.

Other minor issues were fixed.

The stats page now supports chunked mode, keep-alive and compression, and may be declared in any section with no warning.

Health checks can be started within a smaller delay. http-request/response now support set-map/del-map/add-acl/del-acl to add/remove pattern entries to maps and ACLs on the fly based on data extracted from the traffic.

Heartbleed attacks (CVE-2014-0160) are detected and blocked even on vulnerable OpenSSL implementations.

Source code and changelog are available [here](/download/1.5/src/).
