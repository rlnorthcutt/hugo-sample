As could be expected, 1.4-dev5 did not work very well. The rule is pretty clear : if you don't like your code, it **will** fail. Just reread the last post and you'll see that it was destined to fail. With the nice help of Cyril Bont√© and Hank A. Paulson, we could spot a lot of bugs and I finally got rid of those parts I found ugly. Now curiously, it works a lot better :-) Also, Krzysztof Oledzki contributed a nice feature he talked about some time ago : the **default-server** setting. This makes it possible to specify some common settings globally and not have to repeat them for all servers. This is useful for check intervals, maxconn, etc.. So it was time to release [1.4-dev6](/download/1.4/src/) so that all those who had a bad experience with 1.4-dev5 can try again. This is the version currently running on the site, so it looks fine :-)
