Two extra important issues were discovered since 1.5.1 which were fixed in 1.5.2.

The first one can cause some sample fetch combinations to fail together in a same expression, and one artificial case (but totally useless) may even crash the process.

The second one is an incomplete fix in 1.5-dev23 for the request body forwarding.

Hash-based balancing algorithms and http-send-name-header may fail if a request contains a body which starts to be forwarded before the contents are used.

A few other bugs were fixed, and the max syslog line length is now configurable per logger.

As usual, the source code and changelog are available [here](/download/1.5/src/).
