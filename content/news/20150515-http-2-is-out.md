title: "HTTP/2 is out!"

Today, HTTP/2 officially exists as [RFC7540](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc7540) and [RFC7541](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc7541). The first one describes the protocol itself while the second one is specific to the header compression mechanism called HPACK. HTTP/2 is a major change to HTTP/1 as it introduces multiplexed concurrent streams over a single connection. HAProxy has experienced a major internal architecture redesign during the 1.6 development cycle to address these new requirements. Version 1.6 will not support HTTP/2 yet since the feature freeze is expected at the end of this month, however the architecture should be mostly ready for the future developments to start for real. We expect to support it by the end of the year, during the 1.7 development cycle. It was great to participate to this specification during these 3+ years, I'm already impatient to work on HTTP/3 :-)
