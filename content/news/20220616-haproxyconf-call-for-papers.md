This year, [HAProxyConf 2022](https://www.haproxyconf.com/) will be held physically so that we can meet in person, just as we did in 2019!

It will be held in Paris from November 8th to 9th.

The Call for Papers is now open and ends on September 5th.

Better not wait too much if you already have an idea in mind.

There's a [simplified form](https://www.haproxyconf.com/call-for-papers/#submission-form) to fill to propose a talk.

It doesn't ask much, just your contact and a quick abstract.

If you have no idea yet, think about some great things or tricks you've achieved using HAProxy, or all the stuff tha made your friends tell you "you should really blog about it".

Remember, you have one month and it's counting...
