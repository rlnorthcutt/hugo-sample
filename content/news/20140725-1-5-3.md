Version 1.5.3 fixes a few issues on top of 1.5.2.

Essentialy, a possible memory leak un SSL DHE exchanges, and a possible memory corruption when building the proxy protocol v2 header.

For sure few people will feel impacted, but better release a new version while everything else is calm.

The source code and changelog are available [here](/download/1.5/src/).
