That's a release as I like them, with 6 different contributors providing direct fixes and a few other bringing detailed bug reports.

In short, some issues with out-of-memory conditions were fixed both in the SSL part and in the session management.

Now it should not be possible to crash haproxy even when running with artificially low memory limitations.

Cyril fixed a problem with the agent check accidently inheriting the SSL mode of regular checks.

Denys Fedoryshchenko found that TCP captures could cause random crashes when not using HTTP mode due to the capture pointers not yet being initialized.

Krisztian Kovacs fixed a Proxy Protocol parsing bug.

Thierry Fournier fixed a bug that appears when loading many time the same ACL from a file, causing it to grow and slow down for some linear matches (eg: regex).

A few minor fetches were backported as they make it easier to take action based on the process ID or the stopping status.

The rest are minor bug fixes and improvements.

Users must definitely upgrade, especially if using TCP captures or running under constrained memory conditions.

Code and changelog are available [here](/download/1.5/src/) as usual.
