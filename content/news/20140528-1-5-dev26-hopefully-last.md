This version tries to be the last one in the development cycle.

There were very few changes.

The agent-check was completed.

A potential CPU busy loop when reloading with the systemd wrapper was fixed.

A possible buffer overflow with regex in inlikely configs was fixed.

The "str" match is now used by default for string samples.

No major new feature is considered missing for the final release, so only fixes and minor updates may be merged now.

Source code and changelog are available as usual [here](/download/1.5/src/).
