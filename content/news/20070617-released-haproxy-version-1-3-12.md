Released **[haproxy version 1.3.12](download/1.3/src/)**.

It completes integration of ACL with Content Switching, and allows you to customize your error responses.

Except for the ACL and a few bugs, there have been few changes since 1.3.11.4, and I intend to support 1.3.12 during development and cleanups of the next versions which may not be as reliable.

Several big content providers use 1.3 to regulate the traffic to/from their web servers, and there is a real demand for a stable version with the new features and performance of 1.3.

And considering that some of them even pay for this, I understand they want something really reliable.
