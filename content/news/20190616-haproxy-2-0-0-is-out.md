No that's not a typo, it's really **2.0.0**!

It comes with plenty of shiny new features and scalability improvements, too many to list here, better [read this announcement](https://www.mail-archive.com/haproxy@formilux.org/msg34215.html) instead!

By the way, it's the last week to [send your proposals for the HAProxyConf 2019](http://haproxyconf.com/), please don't forget!
