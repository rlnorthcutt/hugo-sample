This time, nothing really important, just a few issues in the config parser (eg: stop trying to propagate process binding to dynamic backends, stop sending warnings for stats attached to multi-process frontends if it relies on single-process bind lines), a fix for an annoying issue causing the HTTP mode (close/keep-alive) to be ignored in backends, a fix for TCP checks not properly detecting connection failures is there was no tcp-check rule, and better support for supervisord in systemd-wrapper. Since there was no rush here, it can be the good timing to upgrade to a reasonably stable version after testing it calmly :-) As usual code and changelog are available [here](/download/1.5/src/).
