Bart Bobrowski of [who's.amung.us](http://whos.amung.us/) reported abnormal CPU usage with the new version 1.3.16. After a full day of tests and code analysis, I failed to reproduce the issue here, and the bug appeared impossible to me. Bart then offered a lot of help with testing many patches, providing hundreds of megs of traces, so that I could finally fix the issue caused by a nasty race condition. I really appreciate it when users with extreme loads accept to take traces in production, with all the risks that this practise implies. Sometimes it's the only way to get a bug fixed._Thanks Bart!_.  
Since [other minor fixes and enhancements](download/1.3/src/CHANGELOG-1.3.17) were pending, I released **[1.3.17](download/1.3/src/)**, which users of 1.3.16 are invited to upgrade to.
