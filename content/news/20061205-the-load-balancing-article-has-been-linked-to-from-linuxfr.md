The [load balancing article](http://1wt.eu/articles/2006_lb/) has been linked to from [LinuxFR](http://linuxfr.org/pub/).

The small 128 kbps uplink is currently running at full speed but the site is still responding thanks to haproxy queuing the connections to smoothen the traffic.

Next time, I should also write an article on setting up the QoS with tc, because typing remotely with SSH is still very responsive under full load :-)
