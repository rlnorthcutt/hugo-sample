Version 1.5.1 fixes a few bugs from 1.5.0 among which a really annoying one which can cause some file descriptor leak when dealing with clients which disappear from the net, resulting in the impossibility to accept new connections after some time.

This bug was introduced in 1.5-dev25, so affected users are strongly encouraged to upgrade.

For more information, please consult the source code and changelog [here](/download/1.5/src/).

Also today I was pleased to receive a bottle of Champagne sent by our friends at Loadbalancer.org!

Thank you guys!
