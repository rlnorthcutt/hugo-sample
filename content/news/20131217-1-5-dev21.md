title: "1.5-dev21"

Several early testers reported a few annoying bugs yesterday, so I preferred to fix them quickly and issue another release than wasting everyone's time on these bugs.

Use this version instead of 1.5-dev20 to be safe.

Please refer to the [changelog](/download/1.5/src/CHANGELOG) for more information.

Source code is available [here](/download/1.5/src/).
