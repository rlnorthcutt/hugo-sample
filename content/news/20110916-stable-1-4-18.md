title: "Stable 1.4.18"

The fix for the space parsing in the headers that I made of 1.4.17 was not complete, because it results in negative header lengths being returned for headers that are exclusively composed of spaces.

I have checked the whole code to see if this can have any nasty effect, and I couldn't find one, since everytime, we check the length before the contents (we're saved by an optimization).

Still, I don't like having dangerous code lie around, especially in stable versions.

I know for instance that some people apply custom patches on top of it and may get trapped.

So [i have issued 1.4.18](/download/1.4/src/) with that fix.

I also included the recent patch from Finn Arne Gangstad to split domain names on ':' too, as I agree that whenever a port is specified, the host name cannot easily be checked.

And I added a match for header length so that it's now a lot easier to check for an empty header.

The rest are just usual doc and halog updates.

I don't think there is any specific reason to rush on this new version, but if you're in the process of upgrading an older one, please avoid 1.4.17 and use 1.4.18 instead.
