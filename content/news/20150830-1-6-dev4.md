HAProxy 1.6-dev4 has just been issued, please check for the details in [the mailing list's announce](http://marc.info/?l=haproxy&m=144096658314447&w=2). The short version : it's getting better, cleaner and more robust. Still some work to be done before final 1.6 expected in one month, but we're heading straight in the right direction. Code and changelog are available [here](/download/1.6/src/devel/) as usual. Please test it if you haven't yet tested 1.6, especially if you feel like you're using some advanced features or a complex setup, and report issues or successes on the mailing list.
