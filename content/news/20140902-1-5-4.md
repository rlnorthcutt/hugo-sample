A **critical bug** was fixed in 1.5.4.

This bug was introduced in 1.5-dev23, so all users of any version between 1.5-dev23 and 1.5.3 must upgrade.

This bug can cause haproxy to crash if a number of conditions are met together.

Basically, we need a client which can upload multiples of 2GB of POST data much faster than the server can read, and the server must accept all these data slowly enough.

If all of this happens, it is possible during the roll-over at every 2GB that the chunk parser tries to parse a chunk length out of the input buffer, causing haproxy to crash.

In practice, it can essentially be exploited when the attacker controls both the client, the server, and the timing.

This cannot be used to modify data nor execute code though, it's only a denial of service.

**CVE-2014-6269** was assigned to this bug.

Another bug was a possible busy loop in tcp-request content track-sc rules.

Other bugs are less important and can be found in the changelog available with the code [here](/download/1.5/src/).
