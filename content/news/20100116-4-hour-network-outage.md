title: "4-hour network outage"
date: 2010-01-16

Some of you have noticed that the site was down from 11:45 to 15:45 local time, and it can be seen [here](http://whos.amung.us/stats/62nl1k3va5id/). It was the longest outage I ever experienced in 8 years with my ISP ([Nerim](http://www.nerim.net/)). The support told me the outage was at their ADSL provider, [SFR](http://www.sfr.fr/). Well, 4 hours in 8 years is still 99.995% availability, I have nothing to complain about :-)
