This release brings a number of troubleshooting improvements. For example it offers new sample fetch methods to report information about last rule, termination states and syscall statuses in logs, it allows to filter only on anomalies, and exposes more info to the CLI ("show dev", "show sess show-uri"), it now officializes the "traces" section allowing to capture traffic and debugging info permanently, as well as to correlate traces between back and front, and even counts the number of passes on certain key points in the code. On the terrain of configuration stability, the watchdog will now warn early before killing so as to more easily spot dangerous configs, suspiciously low timeouts will now raise a warning suggesting to specify the units, a new hard-limit to file descriptors allows to better adapt to some unbound container environments and duplicate config object names will produce warnings. Architectural improvements were not put at rest, with a new master-worker model that saves a re-exec and is more reliable, the rewrite of the SPOE engine to rely on a much more efficient mux that opens it to all LB algorithms, queuing etc, further improved clock accuracy, the arrival of pacing in QUIC for much higher performance by a massive reduction of losses, the BBR congestion control algorithm, and a 24x performance boost on POST uploads over H2 thanks to adaptive Rx window. There are many other things that would take too long to enumerate here, so please read the details on the [HAProxyTech's blog](https://www.haproxy.com/blog/announcing-haproxy-3-1), and the [mailing-list announcement](https://www.mail-archive.com/haproxy@formilux.org/msg45435.html).
