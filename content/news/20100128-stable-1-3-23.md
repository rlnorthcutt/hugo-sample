Several minor bugs were fixed since **1.3.22**, and the **request-learn**, **force-persist** and **http-check send-state** were backported because people need them for more transparent and reliable application updates. Since no new bug was in sight, and 3.5 months had elapsed since 1.3.22, it was the moment to release [1.3.23](/download/1.3/src/) with all that. As 1.4 approaches, 1.3.23 will probably be the last 1.3 which accepts new [minor features](/download/1.3/src/CHANGELOG). Future 1.3 versions will very likely be dedicated to bug fixes only.
