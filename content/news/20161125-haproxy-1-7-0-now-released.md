HAProxy 1.7.0 was released on 2016-11-25.

It is considered by some of its contributors as the cleanest release ever produced.

The development cycle for this version was focused on making it more reliable, more modular and more evolutive.

And it pays, because most of the recent new features did not require any core change, resulting in a more reliable core engine and less bugs expected over time.

There are too many improvements to list them here ; for a detailed description of the changes since 1.6, please [consult the announcement here](https://www.mail-archive.com/haproxy@formilux.org/msg24244.html).

Consecutive to this update, the haproxy.org website was also [upgraded to version 1.7.0](http://demo.haproxy.org/) and a new SSL certificate was installed now that [StartSSL](https://www.startssl.com/) accepts up to 10 hostnames per domain on free certs.

Code and changelog are available [here](/download/1.7/src/).
