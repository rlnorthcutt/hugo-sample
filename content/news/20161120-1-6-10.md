HAProxy 1.6.10 was released on 2016-11-20.

A few issues were fixed.

The first one is a final fix for the connection layer with the revert of the previous incorrect fix that went into 1.6.8 and 1.6.9, which could cause some unkillable tasks to happen.

Two bugs in the peers' task management were also fixed, putting an end to the few occasional reports of stale CLOSE\_WAIT connections.

Last, the systemd wrapper's signal delivery was fixed to ensure the signals are not lost and the wrapper always knows whether haproxy has finished starting or not.

This ensures reload signals are not lost while the config is being parsed.

The complete announcement is [available here](http://www.mail-archive.com/haproxy@formilux.org/msg24187.html).

Code and changelog are available [here](/download/1.6/src/) as usual.
