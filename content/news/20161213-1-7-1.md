HAProxy 1.7.1 was released on 2016-12-13.

It fixes a few regressions introduced during 1.7 and some painful bugs pre-dating 1.6 related to behaviour under low memory condition (thus expect 1.6.11 soon).

The most notable 1.7 regressions that were fixed concern the CONNECT method which stopped working in 1.7, two typos on "show stat resolvers" and "show tls-keys" causing the output to be empty, a possible crash with "show stat" on a backend with no LB algorithm (dates back to 1.4 except that it would print "(nil)" by then), and support for LibreSSL was fixed.

There are a few other small things and doc fixes, for more info, it's recommended to [read the announcement here](https://www.mail-archive.com/haproxy@formilux.org/msg24339.html).

Code and changelog are available [here](/download/1.7/src/) as usual.
