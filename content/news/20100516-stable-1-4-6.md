Version 1.4.5 triggered a conflict in a macro name with some Linux distros shipping glibc >= 2.10.

Since this affects most recent distros, it was better to upgrade now.

A few points about RDP cookies were clarified in the doc.

Last, a new ACL match **srv\_is\_up()** has been added, to consider a specific server's state in ACLs.

Those who had no problem building 1.4.5 don't really need to upgrade. mixing them with fixes.
